# Prime Number Estimation and Analysis

This Python project allows you to estimate prime numbers within a specified range, both in parallel and non-parallel versions. It provides estimates of the time it takes to find prime numbers and stores the results for future reference. Additionally, it includes a script to view and analyze the stored results.

## Features

- Estimate prime numbers within a specified range.
- Compare parallel and non-parallel computation times.
- Store and view results for different input ranges and thread counts.
- Analyze time differences and estimated times based on stored results.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. `main.py`: The main script for estimating prime numbers and storing results.
2. `estimator.py`: The module containing functions for prime number estimation.
3. `see_results.py`: A script to view and analyze stored results.
4. `results.pkl`: A data file for storing the results.
5. `generate_data.py`: A script to generate random data for analysis.
6. `.gitignore`: A file specifying files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Getting Started

python main.py
 
python see_results.py

You should create a `requirements.txt` file that includes the required dependencies. If you encounter any bugs in the future, you can add them to the "Known Issues" section with descriptions and steps to reproduce, if possible.
